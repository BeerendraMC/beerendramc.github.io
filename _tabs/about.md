I'm a passionate programmer based in Bengaluru, India 🇮🇳, with over 7 years of experience building scalable, maintainable, and reusable web solutions across diverse domains. My expertise covers the full application lifecycle: from designing and building applications to writing comprehensive test cases, deploying, and maintaining them. My toolkit is robust, featuring languages like JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, and C#, and frameworks such as Angular, React, Express, FastAPI, and .NET Core. I'm equally adept with both SQL and NoSQL databases, always focused on crafting high-impact web applications. I also have hands-on experience in setting up GitLab CI/CD pipelines for seamless integration and delivery.

Currently, I'm at [EY India](https://www.ey.com/en_in){:target="_blank"}, where I'm part of an exciting Generative AI team 🤖. We're busy developing innovative AI solutions to automate workflows and significantly boost productivity and efficiency for our clients. I'm a firm believer in lifelong learning and always keep an eye on emerging technologies and industry trends. 💡

When I'm not coding, you'll find me on long rides with my RE Himalayan 411 🏍️, exploring new horizons. Traveling is a huge passion; it lets me connect with different people, immerse myself in new cultures, and truly explore life's richness. I also have a knack for cooking, and my chicken pepper dry is a personal favorite 😋!
